# MeshCut Visualizations

This folder contains SVG visualizations generated by the MeshCut test suite.

## Files

- **`earcut_comparison.svg`** - Comparison visualization between earcut and meshcut triangulation
- **`meshcut_visualization.svg`** - MeshCut triangulation visualization showing grid-aligned triangles

## Generation

These visualizations are generated by running the test suite:
```bash
cd build
make
./meshcut_visualization_test
```

The SVG files help visualize how MeshCut triangulates polygons while adhering to the specified grid mesh, compared to standard earcut triangulation.

# MeshCut Visualizations

This folder contains SVG visualizations generated by the MeshCut test suite.

## Files

### Basic Visualizations
- **`earcut_comparison.svg`** - Basic comparison visualization between earcut and meshcut triangulation
- **`meshcut_visualization.svg`** - MeshCut triangulation visualization showing grid-aligned triangles

### Complex Shape Comparisons (Side-by-side)
- **`building_footprint_comparison.svg`** - L-shaped building footprint with 32×32 grid
- **`park_boundary_comparison.svg`** - Organic curved park boundary with 32×32 grid  
- **`urban_block_with_holes_comparison.svg`** - Urban block with courtyard holes using 32×32 grid
- **`building_fine_grid_comparison.svg`** - Building footprint with fine 64×64 grid (0.5m cells)

## Generation

These visualizations are generated by running the test suite:

### Basic visualizations:
```bash
cd build
make meshcut_visualization_test
./meshcut_visualization_test
```

### Complex shape comparisons:
```bash
cd build  
make meshcut_visualization_complex_test
./meshcut_visualization_complex_test
```

## About the Visualizations

The complex comparison SVGs show **side-by-side comparisons** between:
- **Left panel**: Earcut triangulation (sparse, boundary-only triangles)
- **Right panel**: MeshCut triangulation (dense, grid-aligned triangles)

These demonstrate how MeshCut provides significantly higher triangle density (30-190x more triangles) for better terrain sampling in 3D applications, while maintaining API compatibility with earcut.

Nice problem — doable and you can get earcut-level speed or better if you structure it right. Below is a focused, practical plan + data structures + * produce a ready-to-compile C++ implementation (with Sutherland–Hodgman + earcut headers + robust integer mapping),
* or produce a micro-benchmark plan and profiler hotspots to tune (which lines to SIMD/parallelize).

Which of those would you like next? (If you want code, I'll output a full C++ file you can compile with earcut.hpp and a small test.)o-optimisations and a small C++ pseudocode/sketch you can copy-adapt. I’ll be direct: the trick is to **avoid running an expensive polygon triangulator on every triangle** — instead classify whole grid *cells* into in/out/partial, only clip & triangulate the partial cells. That reduces work to O(perimeter / cell\_size) clips instead of O(#triangles).

# High level algorithm (fast, practical)

1. **Transform polygon into grid space.**
   Map polygon coordinates to the grid coordinate system where a cell is \[i, i+1]×\[j, j+1]. Working in this normalized space lets you use integer or small-range floats and simple tests.

2. **Compute polygon AABB → grid cell range.**
   Determine minCellX..maxCellX and minCellY..maxCellY to bound work.

3. **Classify cells inside/outside/boundary (partial).**
   For each cell in the AABB:

   * If all 4 cell corners are inside polygon → **full\_in** (emit both cell triangles as-is).
   * Else if polygon edges do not intersect the cell rectangle and no corner is inside → **full\_out** (skip).
   * Else → **boundary** (partial cell). Collect boundary cells.

   Use fast tests:

   * Point-in-polygon for many grid points: do a fast scanline fill (edge buckets per integer Y) or even ray-counting per column (very cache friendly).
   * Segment vs rectangle intersection: use edge bounding-box to quickly reject edges; maintain an edge→cell coarse grid index so you only test edges that could hit the cell.

4. **For each boundary cell: clip the polygon to the axis-aligned square (cell).**
   Use Sutherland–Hodgman polygon clipping against the 4 rectangle halfspaces — extremely fast for clipping by a convex clip rectangle. The input polygon is the original polygon (or only the polygon edges overlapping that cell if you use edge indexing) clipped to that cell.

5. **Triangulate clipped polygon (if non-empty).**
   Use earcut on that small polygon (small N — often <20 vertices). Earcut’s cost is tiny for these tiny polygons. Alternatively if the clipped polygon is convex, do a fan triangulation (O(n)).

6. **Emit triangles: for `full_in` cells, emit the two original grid triangles; for `boundary`, emit triangles from earcut of clipped polygon.**

7. **(Optional) Merge/deduplicate vertices** if you need a single shared vertex buffer: hash vertex coordinates (quantize to grid space) and reuse indices.

# Why this is fast

* Most cells will be `full_in` or `full_out` — no triangulation needed.
* Only cells touched by the polygon boundary require clipping + triangulation. That’s O(perimeter / cellSize) cells — typically much smaller than number of triangles.
* Clipping to an AABB is cheap (Sutherland–Hodgman runs in a few linear ops per clip edge).
* Earcut run on very small polygons costs negligible time; earcut is itself extremely fast for small N.

# Complexity

* Preprocessing: O(n) to build edge buckets (n = polygon verts).
* Classification: roughly O(#cells\_in\_AABB + edges\_intersected) but each check is local.
* Triangulation: O(sum m\_i log m\_i) where m\_i are clipped polygon vertex counts — typically tiny.
  Overall close to O(n + k) where k = number of cells in bbox / boundary complexity; for fixed grid resolution (32×32) it’s effectively linear in polygon vertex count.

# Implementation details & robust tips

* **Use grid-space integers if possible**: scale coordinates so cell boundaries are integer (avoid FP equality issues). Use 64-bit integer arithmetic if input coordinates are large.
* **Point-in-polygon for many grid points**: do an active-edge-table (scanline) approach — build edges bucketed by integer Y rows and increment crossing counts as you move across X. This yields inside/outside for all grid corner points in one pass.
* **Edge→cell acceleration:** build a simple spatial index (edge boxes hashed to cell indices) so you only test edges that might intersect a cell when checking for segment-rectangle intersection.
* **Clipping to rectangle:** Sutherland–Hodgman is ideal: clip the **(outer) polygon** against the four cell half-planes sequentially. If polygon has holes (rings), handle each ring separately; for holes you normally subtract them (clip each ring then classify orientation).
* **Avoid per-cell memory allocs:** reuse buffers when clipping/triangulating. Preallocate vector capacity to a small constant.
* **Parallelism:** boundary cells are independent — process them with threads if you need more throughput.
* **Numerical robustness:** when computing intersection of segment with cell boundary, use epsilon rules; or use integer intersection formulas (rational arithmetic) if you mapped coords to integers.
* **Vertex deduplication:** if you want a single mesh (shared vertices across cell boundaries), quantize vertex coordinates to a canonical representation (e.g., store as pair\<int,int> after scaling) and use unordered\_map to reuse indices. This is optional — if speed > memory coherence, emitting per-cell triangles without global dedup is fastest.

# Further optimisations (if you need even faster than baseline)

* **Merge boundary cells into runs / polygons**: instead of clipping each cell separately, run a marching-squares like step to form the continuous clipped area polygon(s) that follow grid edges; triangulate those larger polygons (fewer earcut calls). More coding but fewer triangulations.
* **Rasterization-first approach:** rasterize polygon to a fine grid of cell corners/centers; fill interior using scanline; then only clip boundary cells. This is especially good if polygon vertex count is large.
* **Avoid earcut entirely on boundary if clipped polygons are monotone**: you could use a fast monotone polygon triangulator or trapezoidation if you can guarantee monotonicity after clipping (rare). Earcut is fine for small polygons.

# C++ sketch (core pieces)

Below is a compact C++-style pseudocode sketch showing the main pipeline; this is intentionally minimal — adapt to your geometry types and earcut library.

```cpp
// types: Point { double x,y } or integer types after transform
// polygon: vector<Point> outerRing (and optional holes as vector<vector<Point>>)

// 1. transform to grid coordinates: scale + translate so each cell is unit square
//    (x' = (x - gridOriginX)/cellSize)

struct Cell { int i,j; enum {FullIn, FullOut, Boundary} state; };

void processPolygon(const Polygon& poly, int gridW, int gridH, double cellSize, Point gridOrigin) {
    // compute polygon bbox in grid coords
    auto bbox = compute_bbox(poly);
    int minI = floor((bbox.minX - margin)/cellSize);
    int maxI = ceil((bbox.maxX + margin)/cellSize);
    int minJ = floor((bbox.minY - margin)/cellSize);
    int maxJ = ceil((bbox.maxY + margin)/cellSize);
    clamp to grid.

    // Build edge buckets by integer Y for fast scanline point-in-polygon if you want
    build_edge_buckets(poly);

    // For each cell in bbox:
    for (int j=minJ; j<=maxJ; ++j) {
      for (int i=minI; i<=maxI; ++i) {
        // corners in grid coords:
        Point c0 = {i, j}, c1 = {i+1, j}, c2 = {i+1, j+1}, c3 = {i, j+1};
        bool in0 = pointInPolygon(c0, poly);
        bool in1 = pointInPolygon(c1, poly);
        bool in2 = pointInPolygon(c2, poly);
        bool in3 = pointInPolygon(c3, poly);

        if (in0 && in1 && in2 && in3) {
          emitTwoGridTriangles(i,j); // full in
          continue;
        }

        // quick reject: no corner inside AND no edge intersects cell bounds?
        if (!in0 && !in1 && !in2 && !in3 && !polygonIntersectsRect(poly, Rect{i,i+1,j,j+1})) {
          continue; // full out
        }

        // boundary cell:
        // Clip original polygon to rect [i,i+1]x[j,j+1] via Sutherland-Hodgman
        std::vector<Point> clipped = clipPolygonToRect(poly, Rect{i,i+1,j,j+1});
        if (clipped.empty()) continue;

        // Triangulate clipped polygon (earcut works with vector of rings; for a single ring:)
        std::vector<uint32_t> triIndices = earcut(clipped);
        emitTrianglesFromClipped(clipped, triIndices);
      }
    }
}
```

# Sutherland–Hodgman for rectangle (very fast)

Clip `inPoly` by the four halfplanes `x>=i`, `x<=i+1`, `y>=j`, `y<=j+1`. Each clip step scans vertices once — O(m) per clip. Since m is original polygon vertex count but early reject with bbox reduces work, typical clipped polygon vertices are small.

# Holes / multiple rings

* Treat outer ring and each hole ring separately. For holes, clipped polygons are subtracted — after clipping you must respect ring orientation and earcut accepts multiple rings (outer then holes). If you clip a hole ring and it produces polygons, mark as hole rings to earcut.

# Edge cases & robustness

* Extremely small sliver intersections might create degenerate polygons — drop polygons with area < eps.
* Colocated vertices: dedupe consecutive equal points before triangulation.
* Self-intersecting polygons: pre-clean with a robust polygon library if your inputs can be invalid.

# Expected performance numbers (qualitative)

* For typical lake polygon and 32×32 grid: boundary cells maybe a few dozen to a few hundred; earcut on sub-20-vertex polygons is microseconds each — negligible. The bulk of time is the point-in-polygon classification and a handful of intersection tests. This will be comparable to or faster than running earcut once on the entire polygon (earcut produces triangles that ignore the grid), because you're not generating arbitrary triangles — many cells are emitted trivially.

# Final recommendation (concrete)

* Implement the pipeline above: transform to grid space → scanline or point-in-poly to classify corners → sutherland-hodgman per boundary cell → earcut for clipped polygons. Optimize hotspots:

  * Build edge buckets for fast scanline or segment vs cell tests.
  * Reuse buffers, avoid allocations.
  * Parallelize boundary cell processing if needed.

If you want, I can:

* produce a ready-to-compile C++ implementation (with Sutherland–Hodgman + earcut headers + robust integer mapping),
* or produce a micro-benchmark plan and profiler hotspots to tune (which lines to SIMD/parallelize).

Which of those would you like next? (If you want code, I’ll output a full C++ file you can compile with earcut.hpp and a small test.)
